### How it works
The app gets all its information (event info, lunches, announcements, coupons) from a Google Firebase-powered backend. If you need access to this server, contact [Josh Oettinger](mailto:joshkyle98@gmail.com "Email Josh Oettinger"). You should not need access to the Firebase account to build the app, though.

### Build Instructions

#### From Xcode
Xcode gives you the option to open a project from a repository. Open up Xcode, find that option, and search for School-Chest or paste the link to this repository.

#### From command line
1.  Fork or clone the repository.
2.  Open the Xcode *workspace* (not the plain Xcode project).
3.  Build and run.
