### How it works
The app gets all its information (Event info, lunches, announcements, coupons) from a Google Firebase server. If you need access to this server, contact [Josh Oettinger](mailto:joshkyle98@gmail.com "Email Josh Oettinger").

### Build Instructions
1.  Create a new Xcode project.
2.  Add the files in the School Chest directory to your new project.
3.  Add the Podfile to the same directory as your Xcode project.
3.  Run `pod install` in the project directory to install the required dependencies (CocoaPods).
4.  Open the Xcode workspace and you're all set!
