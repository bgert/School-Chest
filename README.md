# DHS School Chest App

This app was developed in 2017 by Josh Oettinger for Deerfield High School's annual charity fundraiser.

### How it works
The app gets all its information (Event info, lunches, announcements, coupons) from a Google Firebase server. If you need access to this server, contact Josh Oettinger (`joshkyle98@gmail.com`).


 ### Build Instructions
1.  Create a new Xcode project
2.  Add the files in the School Chest directory to your new project
3.  Run `pod install` in the project directory to install the required dependencies (CocoaPods)
4.  Open the Xcode workspace and you're all set
